## SHORT DESCRIPTION (≤160 chars)

```

## LONG DESCRIPTION (300–500 chars, no markdown)

```
GitHub Actions workflows are security blind spots. Detect unpinned actions (the tj-actions attack vector), overly broad permissions, and script injection vulnerabilities in seconds. Auto-fixes unpinned actions by resolving tags to commit SHAs. Outputs text, JSON, SARIF for GitHub Code Scanning, or markdown reports. Zero dependencies. Built after 23k+ repos were compromised by a single malicious action.
```
